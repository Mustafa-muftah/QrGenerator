### About the app

- this app is built with reactjs and typescript with multiple dependencies 
1- redux toolkit for managing app state (I could avoid use it)
2- react-query for managing api request and caching 
4- tailwind for UI 
5- react router to handling routing

### Folder structure 

- global Folder : Contains all resuable component can be used any where.
- screens Folder : contains the screen components.
- hooks : contain our custom hooks to fetch data.
- appState: contain the redux logic and app store.

- I did two solutions the first commit is with Redux toolkit, the Second commit with react-query as required, I prefer state managemat solution or mix both of them
- there would be some UI bugs and bad UI/UX experience (ex: history page) due to lack of time
